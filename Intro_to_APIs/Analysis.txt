1.) It is clear, from the Latitude vs. Max Temperature plot, that cities with latitudes further
away from 0 had lower maximum temperatures. The line is clearly defined to support this obvious
conclusion. 
2.)Latitude had no clear correlation with cloud cover, humidity, or wind speed.
3.)Cloud cover, while having no correlation with latitude, did show consistency over multiple
cites. This tells me that either these cities are close enough together in longitude that they
are experiencing the same cloud cover or the way in which cloudiness is measured it arbitrary.
