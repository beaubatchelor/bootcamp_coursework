##Data and Cleaning
I pulled in data from the same month in for 5 different years.

Then I deleted unknown gender values because they made up a minor portion of the overall data.

After that I deleted null values in the age because they also made up a minor portion of the overall data.

##Visualizations
So I then decided to find who is the best customer by age and gender. I found that males from 30 to 40 by far are the most active users.

Then after reading the different subscription types, it is not necessarily the frequncy but the average use time that makes a better customer. I calculated for this and found that the results were the same.
